# 👋 Hi, I’m Pratik

I am a BCA student focusing on frontend web development.

I have built multiple beginner-level projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to practice UI design, component-based structure, and basic application logic.  
Currently, I am strengthening my JavaScript fundamentals and building React projects with real-world features such as API integration and better project structure.

My goal is to become a job-ready frontend developer by creating production-style projects and improving my problem-solving skills.
